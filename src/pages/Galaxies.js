                  <p>The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way and is one of a few galaxies that can be seen unaided from the Earth. In approximately 4.5 billion years the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are expected to collide and the result will be a giant elliptical galaxy. Andromeda is accompanied by 14 dwarf galaxies, including M32, M110, and possibly M33 (The Triangulum Galaxy).</p>

                  <p>IC 10 is an irregular dwarf galaxy with an H II nucleus of about 5,000 light-years across, located some 2.2 million light-years away in the northern constellation Cassiopeia and it is approaching the Milky Way at approximately 350 kilometers per second.</p>

It consists of four globular clusters, the main cluster having been discovered in 1994. Sgr dSph is roughly 10,000 light-years in diameter, and is currently about 70,000 light-years from Earth</p>

                  <p>IC 1101 is among the largest known galaxies, but there is debate in the astronomical literature about how to define the size of such a galaxy. It's size is astonishing 15 to 37 kpc (50 to 120 thousand light years). Like most large galaxies, IC 1101 is populated by a number of metal-rich stars, some of which are seven billion years older than the Sun, making it appear golden yellow in color.</p>

                  <p>The Sombrero Galaxy, one of the more unusual-looking barred spiral galaxies, owes its name to its resemblance to the Mexican hat of the same name. It has a large central bulge and a bright nucleus, and its spiralâ€™s arms pass through a thick dust lane, which is the ring encircling the central bulge.</p>

                  <p>Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a grand design spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, with a diameter of 90,000 light years, about half the size of the Milky Way, in the constellation Ursa Major. Due to its proximity to Earth, large size, and active galactic nucleus (which harbors a 70 million supermassive black hole), Messier 81 has been studied extensively by professional astronomers. The galaxy's large size and relatively high brightness also makes it a popular target for amateur astronomers.</p>

                  <p>Segue 2 is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy situated in the constellation Aries and discovered in 2009 in the data obtained by Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy is located at the distance of about 35 kpcs (35,000 parsecs (110,000 ly)) from the Sun and moves towards the Sun with a speed of 40 km/s.</p>
