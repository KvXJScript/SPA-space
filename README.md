## introduction

This was a few month long project. Project goals included using technologies that I understood and these one's that I learned before. Threw the time while I was doing this project I was developing my other features such as styled components, redux, react-redux, gsap, OAuth, RWD. Right now I am planning to do new project which will include redux, styled components, react-redux, LoDash and OAuth. Then I'll go for gsap, RWD and some features which I'll inlude over time.


## few things about the project

Originally I wanted to build app which would contain 3 things which I love - Web Development, React and last but not least Space. I just wanted to share with you with a few awesome informations from space such as amazing planets, galaxies and some fancy API from NASA. I started this project by using create-react-app.


# Biggest Challenges

One of the main challanges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days at youtube, udemy and documentation to set it finally up. I didn't focus that much on styling such page, that's why it isn't responsible. It follows a few RWD concepts but still it's main reason still wasn't full responsible web app. 


# Technologies used to do this project
Last but not least, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, CssTransition, Sass, BEM methology, API, Authentification, JSX, React Hooks. I chose to use create-react-app bolierplate, because it is such a awesome thing which helps alot with minimalizing initial setup and it gives more time to dive into coding.
